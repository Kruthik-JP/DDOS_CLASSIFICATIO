# DDOS_CLASSIFICATION
 DDoS classification using AIML involves detecting traffic patterns, such as high request volume or IP anomalies, to identify and mitigate malicious attacks on a network.
# DDoS Detection and Mitigation System

## Project Description
This project implements a comprehensive system for detecting and mitigating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using machine learning and statistical analysis. The system analyzes network traffic data to classify requests as benign or malicious, providing insights into potential threats and enabling proactive measures to protect network resources.

## Problem Statement
DDoS attacks pose a significant threat to online services, leading to service outages and financial losses. Traditional methods of detection and mitigation are often insufficient due to the evolving nature of these attacks. This project aims to develop a robust solution that leverages machine learning algorithms to accurately identify malicious traffic patterns and implement effective mitigation strategies.

## Key Features
- *Data Analysis*: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and visualize traffic patterns.
- *Machine Learning Models*: Implementation of various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks.
- *Statistical Analysis*: Hypothesis testing to determine the significance of differences in traffic patterns between benign and malicious requests.
- *Anomaly Detection*: Identification of anomalous traffic based on packet counts and other features.
- *Mitigation Strategies*: Implementation of techniques such as IP blocking, rate limiting, geo-blocking, and traffic shaping to mitigate detected threats.
- *Visualization*: Comprehensive visualizations to illustrate traffic patterns, anomalies, and model performance metrics.
